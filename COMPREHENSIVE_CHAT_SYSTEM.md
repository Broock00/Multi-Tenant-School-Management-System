## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Backend Changes**

#### 1. **Comprehensive Management Command**
```python
# chat/management/commands/setup_comprehensive_chat_rooms.py
# Creates all 6 types of chat rooms with proper role-based access

# 1. System ↔ School Admin rooms
for school in schools:
    room_name = f"System ↔ {school.name}"
    system_school_room = ChatRoom.objects.create(
        name=room_name,
        room_type='system_school_admin',
        description=f'System Admins ↔ {school.name} School Admins'
    )

# 2. School Admin ↔ School Admin rooms
for admin1, admin2 in combinations(school_admins_for_school, 2):
    room_name = f"{admin1.username} - {admin2.username} ({school.name})"
    admin_admin_room = ChatRoom.objects.create(
        name=room_name,
        room_type='school_admin_to_admin'
    )

# 3-5. One-on-one rooms for different role combinations
# ... (similar pattern for other room types)
```

#### 2. **Enhanced API Views**
```python
# chat/views.py - Enhanced filtering based on user role and school
def get_queryset(self):
    user = self.request.user
    if user.role == 'super_admin':
        return ChatRoom.objects.filter(room_type__in=['system_school_admin', 'general_staff'])
    elif user.role == 'school_admin':
        return ChatRoom.objects.filter(
            participants=user,
            room_type__in=['system_school_admin', 'school_admin_to_admin', 'school_admin_to_secretary', 'school_admin_to_teacher']
        )
    # ... (similar for other roles)
```

### **Frontend Changes**
