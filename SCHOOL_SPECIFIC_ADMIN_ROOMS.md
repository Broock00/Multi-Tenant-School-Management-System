# School-Specific Admin Rooms Implementation

## 🎯 **Overview**

Successfully implemented **separate admin chat rooms for each school**, where each school has its own dedicated admin room for communication between System Admins and School Admins.

## ✅ **Key Features Implemented**

### 1. **School-Specific Admin Rooms**
- **Separate room per school**: Each school has its own admin chat room
- **Room naming**: "{School Name} - Admin Chat" format
- **Dedicated participants**: System Admin + School Admin for that specific school
- **Isolated communication**: Messages only visible to participants of that school's admin room

### 2. **Message Visibility**
- ✅ **School-specific visibility**: Messages only visible to System Admin and School Admin of that school
- ✅ **Isolated communication**: No cross-school message visibility
- ✅ **Message history**: Preserved per school admin room

### 3. **Unread Message Tracking**
- ✅ **Automatic marking**: Messages marked as unread for recipient (not sender)
- ✅ **Individual tracking**: Each user's read status tracked separately
- ✅ **Unread count badges**: Automatic calculation and display per room
- ✅ **Mark as read**: Individual message and bulk room marking functionality

### 4. **Room Identity**
- ✅ **School-specific identification**: Each room tied to a specific school
- ✅ **Persistent rooms**: Rooms persist and are reused for each school
- ✅ **Clear naming**: Easy identification of which school each admin room belongs to

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Backend Changes**

#### 1. **Management Command Updates**
```python
# chat/management/commands/setup_sample_chat_rooms.py
# Creates separate admin room for each school
schools = School.objects.all()
for school in schools:
    school_admin = school_admins.filter(school=school).first()
    
    if school_admin:
        room_name = f"{school.name} - Admin Chat"
        admin_room = ChatRoom.objects.create(
            name=room_name,
            room_type='admin',
            description=f'Administrative communication for {school.name}',
            is_global_admin_room=False  # School-specific admin room
        )
        
        # Add System Admin and School Admin to this room
        ChatParticipant.objects.get_or_create(room=admin_room, user=admin_user)
        ChatParticipant.objects.get_or_create(room=admin_room, user=school_admin)
```

#### 2. **API Updates**
```python
# chat/views.py - MessageViewSet
def perform_create(self, serializer):
    """Set sender and mark as unread for all recipients except sender"""
    message = serializer.save(sender=self.request.user)
    
    # Mark message as unread for all room participants except sender
    room_participants = message.room.participants.all()
    for participant in room_participants:
        if participant.user != self.request.user:
            MessageRead.objects.get_or_create(
                message=message,
                user=participant.user,
                defaults={'read_at': None}
            )
```

### **Frontend Changes**

#### 1. **SystemChat.tsx Updates**
- ✅ **Multiple school rooms**: Shows all school-specific admin rooms
- ✅ **School identification**: Clear display of which school each room belongs to
- ✅ **Message alignment**: Sender/receiver distinction with proper styling
- ✅ **Time formatting**: Simplified HH:MM AM/PM format
- ✅ **Unread badges**: Automatic unread count display per room

#### 2. **Chat.tsx Updates**
- ✅ **School admin view**: Shows only their school's admin room as "System Administrator"
- ✅ **Role-based filtering**: Proper access control for different user roles
- ✅ **Message display**: Consistent styling with SystemChat

## 🔄 **Migration from Global Admin Room**
